//personal notes
I am actually starting this late, and with technical difficulties, have lost significant progress. 
What I get for procrastinating and overestimating my abilities, none the less I'll try my best to make up for lost points.
I like to work under pressure so i make a habit of procrastinating; it's when I'm most focused and it tends to work out usually. 
This is not one of those times and I shall work to remedy this comprimising trait of mine.
